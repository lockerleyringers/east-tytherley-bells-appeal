        <p>
          <a href="http://wpbells.org/towers/east-tytherley/">St Peter's church in East Tytherley</a> has eight
          bells, the tenor weighs 14 cwt,
          cast by John Taylor &amp;
          Co. in 1897 (the two trebles were added two years later).
          The bells have not been rehung and are still on original
          plain bearings; this, coupled with a fairly long draft,
          make them slightly harder to ring than the bells at Lockerley
          and less suitable for teaching learners, although most
          ringers have little difficulty ringing them. The second
          bell is hung above the other bells making it harder to
          hear above the sound of the other bells, a sound tube
          has just been installed to improve the sound balance
          in the ringing room. Work has been carried out to install
          sound insulation which makes the sound level in the ringing
          room far more comfortable than previously.
