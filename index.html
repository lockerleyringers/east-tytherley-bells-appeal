        <p>
          The magnificent bells of East Tytherley Church have called the community to worship and celebration for over 125 years. 
          Installed in the late 1890s, these historic bells have faithfully marked countless services, weddings, and special occasions, 
          their voices carrying across the village and surrounding countryside.
        </p>
        <p>

          However, after more than a century of faithful service with minimal maintenance, our beloved bells are now in urgent need of 
          restoration.  The bell fittings, particularly the crucial bearings that allow the bells to swing freely, have become severely 
          worn through decades of use. What was once an easy-going peal has become increasingly difficult to ring, 
          putting enormous strain on our dedicated team of local ringers.
        </p>
        <p>

          Our committed band of bell ringers, who have lovingly maintained this ancient tradition, now face the heartbreaking 
          reality that without immediate intervention, these historic bells may soon fall silent. 
          The deteriorated bearings make ringing physically challenging, threatening to end a tradition that has 
          been passed down through generations.
          
        </p>
        <p>
            We need £35,000 to save our bells and keep them ringing for another 125 years.
